OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

PROJECT : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

OBEJECTIVE 
 To implement a simple linear regression model for predicting continuous target variables, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
 
 KEY FEATURES :
  
  1.Data Preprocessing - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
  2.Model Training - Using Linear Regression to learn relationships in the data.
  3.Evaluation Metrics - Measuring performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
  4.Visualization - Plotting regression lines and actual vs predicted values for accuracy assessment.

 TECHNLOGY USED :
  Python - Programming Language.
  Libraries/Modules:
    NumPy - Data generation and numerical computations.
    Pandas - (Optional) Data manipulation (not used in the provided code).
    Matplotlib - Data visualization.
    Scikit-learn - Model implementation, training, testing, and evaluation.
